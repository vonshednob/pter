;; This is an example configuration file for pter.
;; All values presented here are the default values.

[General]
;; Whether or not to use colors.
;; You should not have to change this only because your terminal does not
;; support colors because that case should automatically be detected.
;; If you'd rather not use colors, change to 'no'.
;use-colors = yes

;; Whether or not to show numbers for tasks
;show-numbers = yes

;; Keep at this amount of tasks between the selected task and the top or
;; bottom edge of the terminal.

;; Whether or not the search should be case-sensitive
;search-case-sensitive = yes

;; Save changes to the edited files in a save manner.
;; When enabled changes to the edited file are saved to another file in the
;; same folder first and then moved into place of the actual file.
;; This might be problematic if your file is a folder that's synchronised
;; via DropBox or similar cloud storage services.
;safe-save = yes

;; Human-friendly dates
;; Display relative dates (like 'tomorrow', '2 weeks ago') instead of
;; YYYY-MM-DD formatted dates for some (t, due, created, completed) or 'all'
;; dates. By default there is no friendliness to humans.

;; Please have a look at the documentation for the details on how to

;; Contexts to remove when marking a task as done
;; When marking a task as done, you might want to automatically remove contexts.
;; In that case you can define them here separated by comma.
;; For example:
;;   clear-contexts = in, today
;; No contexts are removed by default:
;clear-contexts =

;; The default t: search value
;; Even if the search field is empty, the search will adhere to this t: filter
;; value. That means by default tasks are hidden that have a threshold in the future.
;default-threshold = today

;; Marker to add to a task when delegating it
;delegation-marker = @delegated

;; Action to trigger when delegating a task
;; This can be changed to 'mail-to' to compose an email with the task text in the
;; subject when you click the shortcut to delegate a task.
;delegation-action = none

;; What attribute to consider the recipient(s) of delegated tasks
;; If you want to define the recipients of delegated tasks differently than by "to:"
;; you can override the name of the attribute here:
;delegation-to = to

;; Whether or not to always add the creation date to a task
;; You can set this to "no" if you don't like the creation date added to every task
;; automatically.
;add-creation-date = yes

;; What protocols are considered when opening URLs of a task
;protocols = http, https, mailto, ftp, ftps
